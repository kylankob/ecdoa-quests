## Chapter 1, Day 1
<strong>1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.</strong>
> A publicly accessible, decentralized and open network of computers that collectively store an ever increasing "list" of data records or blocks. Each new block of data is "connected" to a previous block using cryptography, with each new one added reinforcing the security to past and future blocks as the chain of blocks (blockchain) continues to grow. 

<strong>2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.</strong>
> A sort of "computer program" that defines rules and very specific functions on how any user can interact with a blockchain. If a user would like to store some piece of data in a block on a blockchain, a programmer would need to write a smart contract to accomplish this specific task.

<strong>3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.</strong>
> Both are snippets of code (computer program) that can interact with a smart contract that has been deployed to a blockchain. Scripts are public and don't cost any money, generally they are used to read data from the blockchain. Transactions mutate (change) something on the blockchain and are subject to a gas (transaction) cost and a user signing the transactions (i.e. the one responsible for perfomring the mutation).

## Chapter 1, Day 2
<strong>1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?</strong>
> 1. Safety and Security
> 2. Clarity
> 3. Approachability
> 4. Developer Experience (DX)
> 5. Resource Oriented Programming 

<strong>2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?</strong>
> 1. Safety and Security - making things more difficult to actually "mess up" and avoid inherently potential catastrophes when writing smart contracts is great asset to have in a programming language.

> 2. Clarity - making the language "clearer" by design, certainly will be a helful asset (especially to newcomers) working with the langauge in the wild for the first time.

> 3. Approachability - designing the language in such a way that can seem somewhat familiar to other langauges will certainly benefit those coming from other programming backgrounds.

> 4. DX - at the end of the day, the developer role has the responsibility of creating the methods and means of what exactly users can interact with (bascially be able to actually "do" things on the blockchain). The language designers consideration of improvements to the developer environment will absolutely help the developer be as efficient as possible and ultimately produce a better product.
