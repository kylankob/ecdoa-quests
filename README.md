## Chapter 1, Day 1
<strong>1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.</strong>
> A publicly accessible, decentralized and open network of computers that collectively store an ever increasing "list" of data records or blocks. Each new block of data is "connected" to a previous block using cryptography, with each new one added reinforcing the security to past and future blocks as the chain of blocks (blockchain) continues to grow. 

<strong>2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.</strong>
> A sort of "computer program" that defines rules and very specific functions on how any user can interact with a blockchain. If a user would like to store some piece of data in a block on a blockchain, a programmer would need to write a smart contract to accomplish this specific task.

<strong>3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.</strong>
> Both are snippets of code (computer program) that can interact with a smart contract that has been deployed to a blockchain. Scripts are public and don't cost any money, generally they are used to read data from the blockchain. Transactions mutate (change) something on the blockchain and are subject to a gas (transaction) cost and a user signing the transactions (i.e. the one responsible for perfomring the mutation).
